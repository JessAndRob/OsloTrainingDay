# PR Notes
- InstanceName is null on SMO for Azure SQL dbs - shall I leave it so output matches, or remove for this function?
- Tested with a sql login that has access to master so can connect to instance - this will just connect once to the instance
- Tested with a sql login that only has access to user databases - this will connect to each database passed in
- Any connection methods that Connect-DbaInstance can handle successfully will work here too - tested with SQL Login & Azure AD


## todo
